# Web Development Project 5 - *Pokemon Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Chase Moffat**

This web app: My project is a dashboard that displays all of the first generation Pokemon. My project makes a call to the Pokemon API and displays cards that show the Pokemons
name, type, and stats. The cards are displayed by passing the API data to a Pokemon component that formats the data into a readable card. My project also has search functionality.
Users can directly search for a specific Pokemon by typing their name into the search bar. Users can also filter through Pokemon by type or HP. My project also displays summary
stats. These stats show the total Pokemon, average base experiance, median HP, and most common type for the Pokemon that are currently displayed on the dashboard.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total
